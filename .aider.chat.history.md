Prompt for generating UI image/design (to visualize the mini-app):
"Design a vibrant, mobile-friendly mini-app interface for a cryptocurrency battle game called 'BTC vs ETH Battle'. The screen shows two mascots: a fierce grizzly bear representing Bitcoin (BTC) as the bearish symbol on the left, and a powerful bull representing Ethereum (ETH) as the bullish symbol on the right. In the center, display a real-time updating line chart of the BTC/ETH price ratio, with green/upward arrows if ETH prevails (bull wins) and red/downward arrows if BTC prevails (bear wins). Include a 20-second countdown timer at the top for the selection phase. Below the chart, show two large, glowing buttons: 'PICK BTC (Bear)' in orange and 'PICK ETH (Bull)' in green, each with the animal icon and a 'Select in 20s' urgency text. If the player chooses correctly (the selected asset prevails in the price ratio), display a 'WIN! +10 Points' popup with confetti. Top-right corner has a points counter (e.g., 'Score: 150'). Bottom section includes login buttons for Privy (wallet connect icon) and Twitter (bird icon) for user connection. Use a dark theme with neon crypto accents (green for ETH, orange for BTC), battle elements like lightning sparks between mascots, and a versus symbol. High-resolution app screenshot style, vertical mobile layout."

Prompt for generating mini-app code (React.js with real-time data):
"Write a complete, working React.js mini-app code for 'BTC vs ETH Battle', a simple crypto prediction game. Use the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time BTC and ETH prices in USD (update every 5 seconds via setInterval) and calculate the BTC/ETH price ratio to determine the 'winner' (if ETH gains more vs BTC, bull wins; else, bear). Display bear mascot for BTC (use a simple SVG or emoji) on left and bull for ETH on right. Center: real-time line chart using Recharts or Chart.js showing BTC/ETH ratio over last 1 minute. Top: 20-second countdown timer (use useState and useEffect); when it hits 0, evaluate the round. User picks BTC or ETH via two buttons; if correct (chosen asset prevails in ratio change), award 10 points. Show win/loss feedback. Top-right: points display. Bottom: Connect with Privy (use @privy-io/react-auth for wallet login) and Twitter OAuth (use react-twitter-login or similar). Handle API errors and loading states. Dark theme CSS with crypto colors (orange for BTC, green for ETH), responsive for mobile. Include all imports, components, and a main App.js file. No backend needed; all client-side."

+Code the following app
+```
+Prompt for generating UI image/design (to visualize the mini-app):
+"Design a vibrant, mobile-friendly mini-app interface for a cryptocurrency battle game called 'BTC vs ETH Battle'. The screen shows two mascots: a fierce grizzly bear representing Bitcoin (BTC) as the bearish symbol on the left, and a powerful bull representing Ethereum (ETH) as the bullish symbol on the right. In the center, display a real-time updating line chart of the BTC/ETH price ratio, with green/upward arrows if ETH prevails (bull wins) and red/downward arrows if BTC prevails (bear wins). Include a 20-second countdown timer at the top for the selection phase. Below the chart, show two large, glowing buttons: 'PICK BTC (Bear)' in orange and 'PICK ETH (Bull)' in green, each with the animal icon and a 'Select in 20s' urgency text. If the player chooses correctly (the selected asset prevails in the price ratio), display a 'WIN! +10 Points' popup with confetti. Top-right corner has a points counter (e.g., 'Score: 150'). Bottom section includes login buttons for Privy (wallet connect icon) and Twitter (bird icon) for user connection. Use a dark theme with neon crypto accents (green for ETH, orange for BTC), battle elements like lightning sparks between mascots, and a versus symbol. High-resolution app screenshot style, vertical mobile layout."
+
+Prompt for generating mini-app code (React.js with real-time data):
+"Write a complete, working React.js mini-app code for 'BTC vs ETH Battle', a simple crypto prediction game. Use the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time BTC and ETH prices in USD (update every 5 seconds via setInterval) and calculate the BTC/ETH price ratio to determine the 'winner' (if ETH gains more vs BTC, bull wins; else, bear). Display bear mascot for BTC (use a simple SVG or emoji) on left and bull for ETH on right. Center: real-time line chart using Recharts or Chart.js showing BTC/ETH ratio over last 1 minute. Top: 20-second countdown timer (use useState and useEffect); when it hits 0, evaluate the round. User picks BTC or ETH via two buttons; if correct (chosen asset prevails in ratio change), award 10 points. Show win/loss feedback. Top-right: points display. Bottom: Connect with Privy (use @privy-io/react-auth for wallet login) and Twitter OAuth (use react-twitter-login or similar). Handle API errors and loading states. Dark theme CSS with crypto colors (orange for BTC, green for ETH), responsive for mobile. Include all imports, components, and a main App.js file. No backend needed; all client-side."

+You are an expert full-stack developer. Take the existing open-source repo https://github.com/miniapp-factory/oxb (a Bulls vs Bears clicker mini-app) and upgrade it to a viral, beautiful, real-time crypto battle arena with the following new features:
+
+MANDATORY UPGRADES:
+
+1. Add Email Login via Privy
+   - Already using Privy → just enable "email" in loginMethods
+   - Show email avatar (gravatar or default)
+
+2. Real-time Chart (Crypto Mood Index over time)
+   - Use TradingView Lightweight Charts (https://www.tradingview.com/lightweight-charts/) or react-chartjs-2 with candlestick style
+   - Every fight updates the chart in real-time (green/red candle based on who won the last 100 fights)
+   - X-axis: time (last 50 updates), Y-axis: Mood Index % (0-100)
+   - Smooth line + area fill (green when bullish, red when bearish)
+   - Auto-scroll to latest data
+
+3. Epic Visual Battle Animation (centerpiece)
+   - Canvas or CSS + Framer Motion animation
+   - Huge 3D-looking bull (left) and bear (right) charging at each other
+   - When someone clicks BULL → bull charges forward, screen shakes green, laser eyes glow
+   - When BEAR wins → bear roars, red blood effect, screen shake
+   - Power bars above each animal (fill based on total votes)
+   - Confetti + sound effect optional (use Howler.js or just CSS)
+
+4. Additional Viral Features
+   - After fight: "You just pushed the market X% bullish/bearish!"
+   - Share on X button with dynamic text + chart screenshot
+   - Daily reset counter or "all-time" vs "24h" toggle
+   - Total fights counter with comma animation
+
+Tech Stack (must use exactly this):
+- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
+- Privy.io (already in repo) → add email login
+- Supabase (already in repo) → add new table "mood_history" for chart data
+- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui or custom neon style
+- Lightweight Charts (TradingView) OR Chart.js with candlesticks
+- Framer Motion + react-use for animations
+- react-hot-toast for notifications
+
+New Supabase table:
+`sql
+create table mood_history (
+  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
+  mood_percent numeric not null,
+  winner text check (winner in ('bull','bear')),
+  created_at timestamp default now()
+);
